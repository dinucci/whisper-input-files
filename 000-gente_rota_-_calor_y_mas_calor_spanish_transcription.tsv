0	9000	In the end, according to what I read, in the morning it's hot and hot and hot, because in the morning it's going to rain, but it marks me 36 degrees.
9000	20000	In other words, in the morning, in addition to the heat, the humidity is going to hit you, you're going to be raped, and you're going to start to go to the mosquitos, because I've sung that when I go to the mosquitos, you're going to be eaten by the mosquitos.
20000	30000	A shit in the summer, the truth is a shit, I don't know who the fuck likes this, the guy who likes this is because he likes to have a bad time, because he has a shitty life,
30000	36000	because he probably doesn't want to go back home, because the family must hate him, because in a normal term nobody can like him,
36000	46000	having 35 degrees in the center of the garden at this hour, nobody, nobody can like him, nobody, I'm already sweating, I'm all stuck, I want to grab the steering wheel,
46000	57000	I'm all stuck, I have to grab the steering wheel, this shit, it's hot together, it's in the mirror, it's in the oven, there's a son of a bitch who entered the warehouse six months ago and they already gave him air conditioning.
57000	66000	It's obvious that I owe them, I owe them as a gold, that I keep walking in this twisted pit, that it's hotter together, that I'm sick, I want to die.
